**Title:** Profit Prediction of Companies - Linear Regression

**Description:**

This Jupyter Notebook implements a linear regression model to predict the profit of companies based on their R&D Spend and Administration expenses. It explores data visualization techniques and feature selection to improve model performance.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone this repository:** Use `https://github.com/zoma00/Machine-Learning-for-Profit-Estimation-Insights-from-Analyzing-1-000-Companies.git` to clone this repository locally.
2. **Install dependencies:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (assuming you have a requirements.txt file listing project dependencies) to install required Python libraries.
3. **Open in Jupyter Notebook:** Launch Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the directory containing the notebook (`Profit Prediction of companies Linear Regression.ipynb`).

**Content:**

* **Data Loading and Exploration:** The notebook begins by loading the dataset (assumed to be named `1000_Companies.csv`) and exploring its contents using statistical methods and visualizations.
* **Correlation Analysis:** It investigates the correlation between features (R&D Spend, Administration, Profit) to identify potential multicollinearity.
* **Feature Selection:** Based on the correlation analysis, the notebook might remove features with high correlation to avoid redundancy in the model. (This section might be commented out or adjusted based on your final implementation.)
* **Data Encoding (optional):** If necessary, the notebook might handle categorical features (like State) by encoding them into numerical representations suitable for linear regression.
* **Model Building and Training:** The notebook defines and trains a linear regression model using the prepared data.
* **Evaluation (optional):** It might include code to evaluate the model's performance metrics (e.g., R-squared, mean squared error) to assess its effectiveness in predicting profit.
